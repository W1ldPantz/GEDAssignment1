"How to create a teleportation mechanic for a 3d game" ChatGPT, OpenAI, 24 Oct. 2024.



The scenario being developed is a tower defense game where the player has the ability to teleport from one tower to the next.
The player is expected to teleport around the map, trying to defeat the enemies. 
There will be more than one place where the enemies can spawn and try to attack the player.
The enemies attack the towers, as the player starts losing towers, they will have fewer places to try and defeat the enemies.
The enemies start spawning in slowly, this should give the player enough time to get accustomed to the game and start upgrading their gear. 
As the player starts progressing through the levels the enemies start becoming stronger and more powerful.





I started working on the game back in highschool with the help of my computer science teacher. 
There were basics already built. Things such as the teleportation from the starting tower to one other tower.
I used the help of AI to help build the teleportation mechanic.
AI helped build the singleton, command design pattern, observer, and factory design pattern.
